A fully responsive, beautiful, and modern website for an on-trend full-service barber.

**Link to project:** https://jojishiotsuki.netlify.app/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, HTML5UP
## Optimizations

What I would optimize first is to create a separate page for booking a specific barber and what service they want and display it on a schedule page for them to see which barber and what time they are available.

## Lessons Learned:

Efficient Template Usage: Learning to leverage templates efficiently significantly reduces development time, allowing for a quick and polished website without starting from scratch.

User-Centric Optimization: Recognizing the importance of a dedicated booking system for user convenience and improving the overall functionality of the website.
