**Link to project:** https://jojishiotsuki.netlify.app/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, HTML5UP
## Optimizations

What I would optimize first is to create a separate page for booking a specific barber and what service they want and display it on a schedule page for them to see which barber and what time they are available.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to use templates efficiently and how they cut back so much time from coding it from scratch.
