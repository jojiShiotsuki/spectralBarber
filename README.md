## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, HTML5UP
## Optimizations

What I would optimize first is to create a separate page for booking a specific barber and what service they want and display it on a schedule page for them to see which barber and what time they are available.

To-Do for Optimizations:

Booking System Enhancement:

Create a dedicated booking page for clients to select a specific barber and service.
Implement a schedule page to display barber availability.

Performance Optimization:

Optimize images and other assets to improve page loading times.
Consider lazy loading for images to enhance the website's performance.

SEO Improvements:

Add relevant meta tags, descriptions, and alt attributes for better search engine optimization.

Lessons Learned:

Efficient Template Usage: Leveraging templates efficiently reduces development time, providing a quick and polished website without starting from scratch.

User-Centric Optimization: Recognizing the importance of a dedicated booking system for user convenience and planning improvements to enhance overall functionality.
